Well, theNewBoston tutorial didn't work out so great for me, but that's okay!  I'm sure a lot of people have found that resource to be really helpful.  No offense to Bucky Robinson intended.

Oh, I mentioned this at the top of my phones file, but as I am reading the "You Don't Know JavaScript" series by Kyle Simpson, I am recording his examples in the "YDKJS Series" folder.  All code in these files belong to him, or Getify, depending on their agreements.

But the code written in the "phoneProject" folder is indeed my own based on the examples from aformationed source.
